### The term operating system is commonly used with two different meanings:

- To denote the entire [ɪnˈtaɪər] package consisting[kənˈsɪstɪŋ] of the central software managing a computer’s resources and all of the accompanying [əˈkʌmpəni] standard software tools,such as command-line interpreters[ɪnˈtɜrprətərz], graphical user interfaces, file utilities[juˈtɪlətiz], and editors.
- More narrowly[ˈnæroʊli], to refer to the central software that manages and allocates computer resources (i.e., the CPU, RAM, and devices).

```
- e.g.=exempli gratia[ˈɡreɪʃə]；i.e.= id est 
- Our goods compete[kəmˈpiːt] in terms of product quality, reliability[rɪˌlaɪə'bɪləti] and above all variety[vəˈraɪəti]
- Red eyes denote[dɪˈnoʊt] strain[streɪn] and fatigue[fəˈtiːɡ]
```

### The term kernel is often used as a synonym for the second meaning, and it is with this meaning of the term operating system that we are concerned in this book.
