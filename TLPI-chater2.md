#### The term operating system is commonly used with two different meanings:

- To denote the entire [ɪnˈtaɪər] package consisting[kənˈsɪstɪŋ] of the central software managing a computer’s resources and all of the accompanying [əˈkʌmpəni] standard software tools,such as command-line interpreters[ɪnˈtɜrprətərz], graphical user interfaces, file utilities公用事业; 实用; 效用; 有用; 实用程序; 公用程序;[juˈtɪlətiz], and editors.
- More narrowly[ˈnæroʊli], to refer to the central software that manages and allocates computer resources (i.e., the CPU, RAM, and devices).

```
- e.g.=exempli gratia[ˈɡreɪʃə]；i.e.= id est 
- Our goods compete[kəmˈpiːt] in terms of product quality, reliability[rɪˌlaɪə'bɪləti] and above all variety[vəˈraɪəti]
- Red eyes denote[dɪˈnoʊt] strain[streɪn] and fatigue[fəˈtiːɡ]
```

#### The term kernel is often used as a synonym同义词[ˈsɪnənɪm] for the second meaning, and it is with this meaning of the term operating system that we are concerned担心的; 忧虑的; 感兴趣的; 关切的; 关注的;[kənˈsɜːrnd] in this book.

#### Although it is possible to run programs on a computer without a kernel, the presence [ˈprezns] of a kernel greatly simplifies the writing and use of other programs, and increases the power and flexibility available to programmers. The kernel does this by providing a software layer to manage the limited resources of a computer.

#### The Linux kernel executable typically [ˈtɪpɪkli] resides[rɪˈzaɪdz] at the pathname /boot/vmlinuz, or something similar.The derivation起源，由来，派生;[ˌderɪˈveɪʃn] of this filename is historical

#### Among[əˈmʌŋ] other things, the kernel performs the following tasks:

#### Linux is a preemptive[priˈɛmptɪv] multitasking operating system

####  Memory management: While computer memories are enormous[ɪˈnɔːrməs] by the standards of a decade[ˈdekeɪd] or two ago 

```
, the size of software has also correspondingly grown, so that physical memory (RAM) remains a limited resource that the kernel must share among processes in an equitable[ˈekwɪtəbl] and efficient[ɪˈfɪʃnt] fashion. 
Like most modern operating systems, Linux employs[ɪmˈplɔɪz] virtual memory management (Section 6.4), a technique that confers授予[kənˈfɜːrz] two main advantages[ədˈvæntɪdʒɪz]:
```

#### Provision of a file system: The kernel provides a file system on disk, allowing files to be created, retrieved[rɪˈtriːvd], updated, deleted, and so on
